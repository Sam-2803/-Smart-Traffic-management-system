## Recommendations

Based on the evaluation results, consider the following:

1. **For Heavy Traffic**: Choose the controller with highest throughput
2. **For Environmental Concerns**: Select the controller with lowest emissions
3. **For Emergency Response**: Prioritize controllers with fastest emergency handling
4. **For Fuel Economy**: Consider controllers that minimize wait times and queue lengths
